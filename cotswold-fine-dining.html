            <p>
              Cotswold Fine Dining, a luxury catering company serving the
              Cotswolds, wanted to redesign and rebuild their website. Their
              previous site struggled with confusing navigation, disorganised
              food menus, and inconsistent branding — making it difficult for
              potential customers to browse menus or make enquiries.
            </p>

            <p>
              The goal was to create a more refined, user-centred experience
              that accurately reflected the premium nature of the brand. The
              client wanted the website to act not only to showcase their
              services but as a key touchpoint that communicated their
              dedication to quality and attention to detail.
            </p>
            <p class="bottom-paragraph">
              <strong>The challenge: </strong> Simplify the digital experience
              while reflecting the brand's high-end positioning.

          <h3 class="h3 no-margin-vert cfd-gradient">What Was the Problem?</h3>
          <p>The old website faced some core issues:</p>
          <ul class="list-large">
            <li>
              The visual identity felt
              <strong>inconsistent and outdated</strong> — mixing serif and
              sans-serif fonts, clashing colours, and images that didn't
              communicate the luxury experience the brand promised, and gave the
              site a basic feel which didn’t represent their individuality.
            </li>
            <li>
              Hard to read<strong> food menus, hidden in PDFs:</strong> The menu
              offerings were organised in a very confusing way on the site, with
              it not being clear what each menu was. They were also only
              available via downloadable PDFs, which added unnecessary friction
              to the browsing experience.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h3 class="h3 h3-mid-text cfd-gradient">Solution</h3>
          <ol class="list-large bottom-paragraph">
            <li>
              <strong> Restructured the Navigation: </strong> Simplified the
              menu structure by creating dedicated pages for each menu —
              eliminating the need for PDFs and bringing the food offering to
              the forefront.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong> Modernised the Visual Identity: </strong> Introduced a
              neutral, earthy colour palette inspired by the Cotswolds
              landscape. Paired an elegant serif typeface for headlines with a
              clean sans-serif for body text to create a more consistent visual
              language. The layout also allowed more room for high-quality
              photography.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong> Built with Flexibility in Mind: </strong> Developed the
              site with modular components and reusable layouts to allow the
              client to easily update seasonal menus and promotions without
              compromising the design.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong> Greater Visual Engagement: </strong> Used brand
              photography that had previously been underutilised, bringing the
              food and service offering to life while building trust with users.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong> Accessibility Focus: </strong> Ensured the entire site
              followed accessibility best practices.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong> Microinteractions: </strong> Subtle animations like
              parallax effects, fade-ins on scroll, and zooming image links were
              added to create a more tactile, immersive experience without
              overwhelming the user.

          <h3 class="h3 margin-top-none cfd-gradient">Primary Users</h3>
          <p>
            The primary users were higher-net-worth individuals planning private
            events in the Cotswolds, such as weddings, parties, or corporate
            functions. This audience typically values discretion, quality, and
            attention to detail, but may not always be tech-savvy. They expect
            a premium experience from first touchpoint to final service.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Needs:</strong> Quickly browse menus, understand the level
            of service, and make an enquiry without too much back and forth.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Frustrations:</strong> Clunky experiences, excessive steps
            to find basic information, and anything that feels impersonal or
            overly salesy.
          </p>

          <p class="bottom-paragraph">
            The previous site’s muddled typography and low-quality imagery
            undermined the sense of trust and luxury the brand wanted to
            communicate, making it harder for users to feel confident in their
            decision.
          </p>

          <h3 class="h3 h3-mid-text cfd-gradient">User Journey</h3>

          <p>
            I mapped out some of the existing user journeys for example,
            enquiring about wedding catering.
          </p>
          <p>
            By creating a more intuitive navigation structure and bringing the
            menus to the forefront, I streamlined the journey to make it easier
            for users to reach the enquiry page.
          </p>
          <p class="bottom-paragraph">
            This significantly reduced the number of clicks required and the
            potential for user frustration.
